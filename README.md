# BattleGroundsLootFaster
An AutoHotkey script that lets you pick up stuff faster in PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds. 

# Disclaimer
This is a script and can aide you when playing the game. While all of the movement is being interpolated as input from the user, a ban could still be possible. You are likewise _technically_ cheating, but, laziness prevails. Just be sure to use the script understanding this and at your own risk.

## How to setup bglf
1. Download the [AutoHotkey Installer](https://autohotkey.com/download/) from the [AutoHotkey website](https://autohotkey.com/).
   * After downloading the installer, install AutoHotkey. _Please note that AutoHotkey is a **Windows only** language_.
   * If you have downloaded the .zip file. Unzip the file and run your designated platform .exe _(32 or 64 bit)_.
2. After installing AutoHotkey, download or fork the repo.
   * _You don't need the whole repo to run the script. If you are low on space just download the [main.ahk](https://github.com/ajchili/bglf/blob/master/main.ahk) file_.
3. Run the script. After installing AutoHotkey, simply double click on the main.ahk file and the script will run.

## How to use bglf
1. Start the script, look at the previous section if you need any help.
2. Start up PlayerUnknown's BattleGround.
3. Start your game and enjoy a quick way to get loot.
   * To use the script, open your inventory and then press ``` ` ```. _By default, the script will drag 3 items from the ground into your inventory_.
   * To increase the amount of times that the script will run, press `Numberpad +`. _This will increase the number of iterations by **1** until **10** iterations occur per calling of the script_.
   * To decrease the amount of times that the script will run, press `Numberpad -`. _This will decrase the number of iterations by **1** until only **1** iteration occur per calling of the script_.
   * To display the number of iterations the script will run for, press `Right Control`. _If your keyboard does not have a `Right Control` key, look at the next step to determine what key would work best as a substitute_.
   * To exit the script, press `j`.
4. Make revisions to the script as you see fit. If a better key works for you, change it! A list of all the keys avaliable to use for AutoHotkey can be found [here](https://autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm).
